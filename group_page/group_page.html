    <h2>Brief description of our group project</h2>
    <p>
        Our group's goal is to create a pop art book using the flags of countries related to our group. </br>
        We first choose Canada(studying now) and then we decided to show images of each group member's country (South Korea, China) and Japan, the most famous Asian country.</br>
        The pop-art book we created works by showing users the most iconic models of the country. </br> 
        We will provide QR codes and AR screens that can be used on this page.

    <p><a class= "a1"> Maple Leaf (Canada) : </a> </br>  
    <p class="p1">
    The maple leaf is on the coat of arms of Canada, and is on the Canadian flag. The maple is a common symbol of strength and endurance and has been chosen as the national tree of Canada. </br>
    Maple leaves are traditionally an important part of Canadian Forces military regalia, for example, the military rank insignia for generals use maple leaf symbols.</br> 
    There are 10 species naturally growing in the country, with at least one in each province.</p>

    <p><a class="a1"> Dragon (China) : </a> </br>
    <p class="p1">
    The Chinese dragon, also known as loong, long or lung, is a legendary creature in Chinese mythology, Chinese folklore, and Chinese culture at large.</br> 
    Chinese dragons have many animal-like forms such as turtles and fish, but are most commonly depicted as snake-like with four legs. They traditionally symbolize potent and auspicious powers, particularly control over water, rainfall, typhoons, and floods.</br> 
    The dragon is also a symbol of power, strength, and good luck for people who are worthy of it in East Asian culture.</p>

    <p><a class="a1"> Tiger (South Korea) : </a> </br>
    <p class="p1">
    The tiger (horang-i) plays a significant part in Korean culture. Historically, the tiger has been linked with Korea from the beginning.</br> 
    The tiger is strongly associated with Korean culture and is seen as representative to the identity of Koreans. Tigers in Korea are a symbol of strength and power and often seen as the guardian spirit and protector of the Korean people.</br> 
    Tigers are often featured in many Korean folktales and stories. The tiger is a popular subject of art and paintings in Korea. Through these works you can see evidence of the tiger's significance and sacred standing in Korean society throughout history.</p>

    <p><a class="a1"> Sakura (Japan) : </a> </br>
    <p class="p1">
    The national flower of Japan, the cherry blossom - or Sakura, represents a time of renewal and optimism. </br>
    The pops of pink mark the ending of winter and signify the beginning of spring. Due to their quick blooming season, cherry blossoms also symbolize the transience of life, a major theme in Buddhism. </br>
    Cherry blossoms' magnificent but brief lifespan, falling a couple of weeks after full bloom, reminds people that similar to the delicate white-pink flowers a human's life is also short and beautiful.</p>
